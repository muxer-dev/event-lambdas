Farset Labs’ CoderDojo is run by volunteers from the Farset community and offers a range of computer skills, from web application development to scratch.\nAt a CoderDojo, young people learn how to code, develop websites, apps, programs, games and more. Dojos are set up, run by and taught at by volunteers. In addition to learning to code, members meet like minded people, show off what they’ve been working on and so on. CoderDojo makes development and learning to code a fun, sociable, kick ass experience.\nCoderDojo also puts a strong emphasis on open source and free software, and has a strong network of members and volunteers globally. CoderDojo has just one rule: “Above All: Be Cool“, bullying, lying, wasting people’s time and so on is uncool.\nIt also provides essential teaching and mentorship experience for budding software developers; after all, to teach is to learn twice! And you don’t have to be a hardcore code-hacker to mentor; anyone can help to guide these kids through the processes of problem solving, breaking down tasks, thinking in a stepwise fashion, or just picking out the killer-spelling-mistakes like variable names or missing semi-colons!\nFor more information about Coder Dojo, check out the CoderDojo global webpage.\nYou can also follow us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nWhat should I bring to the event?\nIf you can, please bring your own laptop.\nCan I join as a mentor/volunteer?\nYes! We always appreciate more hands on deck, but we do need to put people through a short induction/training programme first, so get in touch with us on dojo@farsetlabs.org.uk and we can add you to the next induction stream.\nI can’t make it, what can I do to help?\nIf you can’t make it to our Dojo, consider some of the other Dojos in Northern Ireland, like at BMC in Belfast,Ballymena, or the brand new Dojo in Newry.\nIf you just want to support our event here at Farset Labs, please consider making a donation to the charity and mention in your donation that you wish it to go to fund refreshments, resources, materials, and equipment for the Dojo.\nIs there an age limit to enter the event?\nCoderDojo is aimed loosely at the under 18’s, but any child younger than 14 must be accompanied by a parent or guardian and that guardian must stay on-site for the duration of the event\nWhat are my transport/parking options getting to the event?\nWe’re 5 minutes walk from Europa Bus Centre, and Parking is available all across the Weavers Court Campus\nIs there a charge for the event\nFarset Labs’ members operate the CoderDojo for free for all attendees, but donations to cover operating costs are greatly appreciated.\nWhat Child Protection Policies are in place?\nOnly those registered may attend, including mentors.

        "text": "Increasing your strategic impact as a product manager\nTraining Workshop Overview\nEssentials 102  is an overview course intended for confident product managers who are looking to increase their strategic skills and influence. The intention of this course is to help product managers build a strategic layer onto their core product practices, and focus on the soft skills and influencing tactics that are often needed to ensure effective product delivery.  It seeks to answer the questions:\n\nHow can product managers increase organisational understanding of product practice?\nWhat parts of their process can be used as tools for increased alignment?\nHow can product teams craft an evidence-driven product vision and ensure buy-in?\n\nThis course is centered on the senior product manager’s role between the product team and the broader business. In order for teams to deliver effectively, they need buy-in and support from their stakeholders. Participants will gain an understanding of how to sharpen their product practice so that it becomes an alignment and educational tool.  \n\nWhat we’ll cover on the day\nEssentials 102 is a full-day workshop comprised of six modules. Each module includes a lecture component on theory and practice interspersed with up to three hands-on activities. This ensures that participants have an opportunity to apply and work with concepts in a setting that will answer questions and facilitate critical thinking. The following modules will be covered:\n\nEvaluating opportunity: Understanding how to unpack product assumptions and line up macro data to establish product viability and the foundations for product/market fit\nImplementing user research: Breaks down the components of running a user research round and what is needed to ensure maximum value of the time invested\nResearch techniques: Reviewing a range of research methodologies, beyond the classic interview, that help product teams validate problem and solution\nSynthesis: Distilling insights from research and how to collaborate with stakeholders to deepen user understanding and influence\nPrioritisation: Covering a range of techniques and their uses for alignment at points of product development lifecycle\nStakeholder management: A deep-dive into organizational relationships and understanding how to build a communication strategy\n\n\n\nMind the Product Trainers\nEvery Mind the Product trainer is a working product manager who has worked with multiple products and domains. Your trainer’s product management experience enriches the curriculum by delivering diverse perspectives on best practice in different scenarios. You will hear about the products they have worked on in the past, what went well, what didn’t go so well, and how they tried to make improvements. Our trainers’ main goal is not to provide participants with all of the answers, but help facilitate them in asking the right questions.  \n\nAbout Your Trainers\n\nEmma Mulholland, Senior Product Manager\nEmma has over 11 years' experience in Product.
