    "description": "We are delighted that this year's annual meeting will take place at the Wellcome Wolfson Institute for Experimental Medicine.  This is a large purpose-built centre for research located on the Queen's University campus at the Belfast City Hospital Site. Opened in 2015, the WWIEM sits adjacent to the Centre for Cancer Research & Cell Biology and, as such, the venue is the hub of health sciences research in Belfast.\nThe purpose of the meeting is to provide a platform for leading researchers to present their latest findings in basic and clinical pharmacology, and in therapeutics.  There will also be presentations by early-career researchers, and prizes will be awarded for best oral and poster presentations in this category. In addition, the overall winner will have the opportunity to present a talk within one of the symposia at Pharmacology 2019, the flagship meeting of the British Pharmacological Society which will be held in London in December 2019.\nThis year's event will include keynote presentations by:\nKeynote 1 - Jochen Prehn\n(Professor of Physiology & Director, Centre for Systems Medicine, Royal College of Surgeons, Ireland)\nKeynote 2 - Amrita Ahluwalia\n(Professor of Vascular Pharmacology and Co-Director of William Harvey Research Institute, London; Chief Editor of British Journal of Pharmacology)\nKeynote 3 - Danny McAuley\n(Professor and Consultant in Intensive Care Medicine at the Royal Victoria Hospital and Queen's University of Belfast)\nIn addition, there are 8 slots for early-career researchers to make short presentations or to present a poster and prizes are awarded for best oral and poster presentations.",

Learn how to build this understanding into your proposed concept. This workshop helps develop a fundamental skill that ensures your concept is aligned with a true market need or challenge. The result? Product development has a clear route to market and the value you offer will be communicated to your customer with conviction. \r\nInnovation canvas: There are many problems that need to be solved on the way to a successful commercial innovation. We need a framework that poses the questions that a company must address to manage a process that is often tortuous and unpredictable. Borrowing from the model of the Business Model Canvas, KTN has developed an ‘Innovation Canvas’, which is divided into conversation blocks focused on the major issues that must be addressed in the innovation process. Join this workshop to apply your innovation and see which areas you need to focus on.\r\nInvestor readiness – helping you to understand what an investor is looking for: Are you looking to secure investment to grow your business? In this workshop learn about what an investor looks for, how to find committed and interested investors and how to present your business through a memorable pitch.\r\n\r\nAfter an afternoon coffee and networking break, the final part of the day will involve a panel session with successful female entrepreneurs in your region, and talks from previous Women in Innovation award winners.\r\nThe event will conclude with a cheese and wine networking session finishing at 6.30pm.\r\nJoin the conversation on social media using #WomenInnovate",
